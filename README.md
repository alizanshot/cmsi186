# cmsi186
Course materials for LMU CMSI 186 Programming Laboratory class, by year.

Currently has Spring 2017, which is legacy from last year.
....and no, I'm not dumb enough to leave the solutions in there....

Also has code for Spring 2018, which is the current version.  Everything in there is empty, an example of how to do something in Java (or at least ONE way of doing it), or is a test harness to be used to test your code during development.

Now updated for Spring 2019, **WAY** ahead of schedule, but I was bored one day and had to do something to keep my mind occupied so I didn't fall asleep in my chair and embarrass myself by drooling on my keyboard...

Now updated for Spring 2020. as well as for Fall 2020.
