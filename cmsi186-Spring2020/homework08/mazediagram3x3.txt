EOF

  // This describes a 3x3 maze, even though it looks like
  //  it's a rectangle because of the aspect ratio of the
  //  characters used.  The entry to the maze is from the bottom
  //  left at the "S" and the exit is on the side at the top
  //  right, at the "E".
  //
  // The file format is that the first line must have the X and
  //  the Y sizes, separated by a space.  The values must each
  //  contain two characters, e.g., "03", not "3". Each successive
  //  line then defines a row of the maze description.  The dashes
  //  are horizontal walls, the vertical bars are verticla walls,
  //  and the Plus signs mark the corners of each "square" or
  //  "cell" in the maze.
  //
  // It is important that the maze description lines are enclosed
  //  in double quotes as a delimiter to the string on each line.
  //
  // It is also important that the description end with a line
  //  containing the single word "EOF" meaning "End Of File".
  //  This line is used to let the reading program know it is the
  //  end of the maze definition.  Everything after that EOF is
  //  ignored as a comment.
  //
  // Each of the cells has an entry and an exit and is an
  //  object called a "MazeCell".  There are three cells that
  //  only have an entry, meaning they are "dead ends", marked
  //  with a "O" in the diagram above.  The "O" will NOT be part
  //  of the object in the actual MazeSolver program.
