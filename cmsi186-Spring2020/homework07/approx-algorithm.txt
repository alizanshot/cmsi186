      for the number of experiments:
         create a checklist array
            365 elements [no Feb 29th]
            all set to indicate "not used"
         for the number of people:
            create a random birthday index
            use that as index into the checklist array
            if that index is "used" in the array
               increment the counter
            else if NOT used in the array
               set that checklist element to "used"
         end inner loop
      end outer loop

      when the loops are done:
         divide the counter by the number of experiments
         multiply that value by 100
      display the result
